1. Connect to managed databases from outside of Deno Deploy

You can connect to your Deno Deploy KV database from your Deno application outside of Deno Deploy. To open a managed database, set the DENO_KV_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable to a Deno Deploy personal access token and provide the URL of the database to Deno.openKv:

```js
const kv = await Deno.openKv(
  "https://api.deno.com/databases/<database-id>/connect",
);
```

Please check the docs for the specification of the protocol for connecting to a remote KV database
